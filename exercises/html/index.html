    <h3>What kind of website ya wanna make?</h3>
    <p>Oh gosh, right now I really don't have much of an idea of what kind of website to make. However, I will think on it and get back to you.</p>
    <p>Actually, I do want to make a custom homepage for my firefox, I've seen those around. It would be fun and a good way to learn both css and html.</p>
